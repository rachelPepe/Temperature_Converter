# Temperature_Converter

This temperature converter project was a learning problem that I had to solve to practice working with DOM, JavaScript, and event-driven programming.

The Temperature converter takes input in Celsius or Fahrenheit and converts it into the preferred metric. The user can only input one value at a time; as soon as they input text into one box, the other box is cleared out.  Once the user clicks the submit button, the converted degrees show in the opposing values box and a corresponding forecast image.
